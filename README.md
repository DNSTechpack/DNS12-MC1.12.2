## Requests

To make a mod request, please use the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/DNSTechpack/DNS12-MC1.12.2/issues) page and follow these simple rules.

* **Include the mod name in the issue title**
* **One mod per issue.** - For example: If you have 3 mods you wish to request, make 3 issues.

This is to avoid making a duplicate mod request, and makes finding previous requests easier for everyone. Also, don't make a request if we already have it listed as added or if it has not yet been released publicly.

I will reply to requests as soon as I can. I will also add tags to each issue where necessary.
